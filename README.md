## Why Go?

Go was chosen for the backend to explore its:
- Excellent error handling system
- Built-in testing capabilities
- Strong typing and struct system
- Clean syntax and organization

While not all Go features (like goroutines for concurrency) were utilized, the language provided a solid foundation for building a reliable backend service.
